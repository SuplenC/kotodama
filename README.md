# Kotodama

言霊, "the spirit of words": the old belief that spoken words make things happen.

Kotodama is a command menu for Wayland desktops. You type, and it finds and does things: launches apps, switches windows, runs scripts, opens projects, does math, pastes from clipboard history, controls the system. It is built to be faster than anything else of its kind, and everything beyond the core comes from Extensions.

- **`kotodamad`**, a Rust daemon, owns the index, the ranking and the Extensions, and stays warm between uses.
- **A Quickshell QML module** written in Rust (cxx-qt) gives QML a native result model. QML only draws the results.
- **Extensions** are separate processes in any language. They speak a protocol whose wire format is negotiated (JSON, MessagePack or postcard), so a crashing Extension never takes down the menu.

Status: design. See `docs/adr/0001-architecture.md` and the issues.

## Development

One environment, defined by the Nix flake's dev shell, runs everywhere. The `just` recipes run in it on every machine:

- **Linux with Nix**: `just` runs the recipe in `nix develop`.
- **macOS, or Linux without Nix**: `just` runs the same recipe in the dev container, with Docker or OrbStack.

From clone to green tests:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SuplenC/kotodama && cd kotodama
brew install just      # or your package manager, or `nix profile install nixpkgs#just`
just test
```

The first run fetches the toolchain (Rust, Qt 6, Quickshell, sway) into the `kotodama-nix` Docker volume, or into your Nix store. Later runs start in about a second.

| Recipe | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `just shell` | Opens a shell in the dev environment |
| `just check` | Checks formatting and runs the lints (rustfmt, clippy, nixfmt, shellcheck, actionlint) |
| `just test` | Runs the tests; extra arguments go to `cargo test` |
| `just bench` | Runs the benchmarks; extra arguments go to `cargo bench` |
| `just e2e` | Runs the e2e tests against headless sway; `just e2e --update` rewrites the reference images |
| `just image` | Rebuilds the dev container image locally, e.g. after editing `docker/` without committing |

Nix only sees files that git tracks, so `git add` new files before running a recipe.

### e2e tests

`e2e/run` starts sway with the headless backend and the pixman renderer on one 640x480 output, then runs every `e2e/*/test.sh` against it. A test starts its clients with `spawn` and checks the screen with `expect_screen reference.png`, which compares a grim screenshot with the stored image. When a test fails, the screenshot, a diff image and every log are in `e2e/out`, which CI uploads as an artifact.

Hyprland can't run here: it needs a DRM device. Its live tests run in a NixOS VM (`checks.x86_64-linux.nixos-vm`).

### CI

GitHub Actions runs `check`, `test` and `e2e` on x86_64 and arm64, plus the NixOS VM job on x86_64. The bench job (x86_64 only) compares each benchmark with the baseline saved by the last push to `main` and fails when one is more than 50% slower, and warns when there is no baseline to compare against. A weekly scheduled run keeps that baseline from being evicted. Shared runners are too noisy for absolute timings, so CI never checks them.

On pushes to `main`, CI publishes:

- the dev container image to **`ghcr.io/suplenc/kotodama-dev`** (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64), tagged `latest` and with git's hash of `docker/`, which is the tag `just` uses;
- Nix build outputs to the **`kotodama`** Cachix cache, using the `CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN` repository secret.

CI and the dev container read from that cache. To use it with your own Nix, add it to `/etc/nix/nix.conf` (or run `cachix use kotodama`):
